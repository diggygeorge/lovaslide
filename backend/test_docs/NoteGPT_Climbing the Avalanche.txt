Laurene: See that girl. (Pointing at young black girl seated on far right of video screen.) That’s me. Seeing that picture brings back memories of being the only black person in classrooms where almost everyone, students and teachers, were white. In addition, almost all of the curricula and textbooks represented the experiences of white people.

Every picture on the wall was of a white person. I came from a family that was black, but we didn’t talk about what being black meant. I didn’t know who Martin Luther King, Jr. was. I knew nothing about the March on Washington, his speeches or any other part of Black culture. Similarly, I knew nothing of other Deaf people of color’s and who their heroes and sheroes are.

Let me introduce you to the main character in our film, Victoria Monroe. We will be following her journey through the trials and frustrations and in discovering her identity. But her story is not an isolated. We will share the experiences of many other people of different backgrounds who share parts of her journey.

I want to explain the meaning behind the title of this film, “Climbing the Avalanche.” It reflects the challenge that many people of color feel as they struggle through a mountain of obstacles to attain their goals while consistently being swept up in an “avalanche” of whiteness. The rest of this film shares the experiences and journeys of individuals struggling with their identity and culture, while they navigate that climb.

People wonder about the term “Deafhood” and what it means. Here’s Paddy Ladd with his definition: Deafhood is a critical concept. As a result of ongoing oppression, Deaf people have lost a sense of identity, of understanding their true selves as fully realized members of a cultural group. The re­discovery of that identity is an undertaking of the following journey: First, a deep exploration of the impact of oppression on the sense of self and a rejection of this limitation on who we are.

We also need to be mindful of how dominant society relishes our internal divisions that prevent us from collectively challenging our oppression and allows those in power to maintain their positions of dominance and control. Next, we take on the historical studies of Deaf lives. By understanding the achievements of those who have come before us and how they moved forward, we develop more confidence in our own abilities.

The third aspect of Deafhood is the individual journey that each Deaf person undertakes to discover their true identity and purpose here on Earth as a Deaf person. And whether a Deaf person was raised in a more mainstreamed educational setting or at a Deaf school, it is vital that we respect each person’s path.

Finally we study the success of other minority groups. We can learn so much from understanding the lessons learned from other people’s experiences and achievements in navigating through the dominant culture. Just as Paddy Ladd explains that each Deaf person must go on their own journey of self­discovery to understand their own identify of Deafhood, so too it is true that Deaf people of color must undertake a journey to understand their own culture and identity: [graphic of different identity categories from census] People have different cultural identities in addition to being Deaf. This complexity of overlapping elements in people’s identity is called “intersectionality.”

Kimberle Crenshaw defines “intersectionality” this way: Dr. Crenshaw: Intersectionality began as a tool to tell a complicated story about how a group of Black women were experiencing race and gender discrimination. So, when I was a young law professor, I was very much interested in how racism and sexism came together to shape the life circumstances of Black women.

And also how social justice movements, how law, how allies didn’t understand the coming together, so they weren’t present to help when Black women were making claims about discrimination. So, the specific circumstance that gave rise to intersectionality was about a group of Black women who were basically saying we were discriminated against not just as Black “people” not just as “women” but as women who are Black and Black people who are women.

And what they were arguing when they were trying to get a job, at a car manufacturer. And the car manufacturer said, “Well, we don’t discriminate on the basis of race, because we hire Black people.” It just happens that the Black people that they hire are just men. And they said, “We don’t discriminate on the basis of gender, because we hire women.

” It just is that the women that they hired were all white. So, there were jobs that were appropriate for Black people, but they were on the floor. but they were the heavy labor jobs. And there were jobs that were appropriate for women. They were the secretarial jobs. Jobs in the front office.

 So, if you were Black who was a woman, you couldn’t take the Black’s jobs and you couldn’t take the women’s jobs. So, to us, that looks like a clear example of race and gender discrimination. Full stop. But in the courts, the women hadn’t proved race discrimination because Black men were hired. But in the courts, the women hadn’t proved race discrimination because Black men were hired.

So, my task was to try to come up with a visualization so that people could see that these women were subject to two forms of discrimination that were coming together exactly where they lived. So, there was the racism policy and there was the sexism policy and it was the two together that hit these women as Black women.

So, in my mind I was thinking, where is a place in life where we’re vulnerable to two different things coming at us at the same time. And it seems as though an intersection nicely showed that. So, it’s not just that you’re getting hit by racism and you’re not just getting hit by sexism, you’re getting hit simultaneously because of where you are.

So that was the initial articulation of intersectionality. I was interested in telling a fuller story about what these Black women were experiencing. I was also interested in telling a story to their allies about why they need to see this vulnerability as part of what they are committed to. So, the tendency was for, you know, anti­racist agitation and advocacy to say “No, that’s not racism, that’s sexism.

” and I wanted people to see that “No this is a version of racism that you need to be aware of” and the same with respect to feminist. Since then, intersectionality has been used to talk about a lot of things. My next set of articles were about intersectionality in sexual violence, um, intersectionality as it played out with not just Black women, but Latinas.

Not just heterosexual women, but queer women, not just American women, but women around the world, and not just women, but all sorts of people who have multiple vulnerabilities to different forms of discrimination. So, now intersectionality talks about the intersections of, uh, race and gender, and gender identity, transphobia and racism coming together.

And I would also say, um, audism coming together with classism, with racism, everywhere where there’s structures of subordination, and people are located in multiple systems of subordination, they require solutions that are attendant to that intersectional vulnerability. Laurene: The numbers of children of color are growing in both hearing and Deaf populations.

In contrast to this, most of the teachers for these children are white. Here are a few statistics that give a sense of recent conditions: [graphic of statistics] You see the growing percentages of students of color. They don’t necessarily understand their own culture and heritage. In fact, their identity may not be clear to them as they grow up.

You will see individuals share personal stories of their own journeys to discover and understand their own identities and cultures. Erica Hossler: So much of our classroom content is about white people. When students of color only see history told through the experience of white people, it’s no wonder they lose interest.

From what they see, their history books have nothing to do with them. Chad Wolfe: At the Deaf school I attended, there were absolutely no Native teachers. Not one! All the teachers were white. David H.: Going to school, there were a few black students but most of them were white. I didn’t really think of it as being an oppressive situation.

It was just the way it was. Aurora Frias: I new nothing about my culture until very late, around 5th grade. Nha Kim: When did I recognize that who I was, that my identity, was different than other people’s? I knew I was somehow different by the time I was 2 or 3, but I didn’t understand it yet. It wasn’t until my parents divorced when I was 3 and a half or 4 that it became clear.

I moved to Korea with my father for one year and suddenly found myself in an environment where everyone looked like me! I saw no white people, which was so different from what I was used to seeing. Then, when I moved back to the          United States in the mid-­nineties, when I was 5 or so, it became clear to me.

 By leaving a place where I was part of the majority, I finally knew that my identity was different than others in America. Sarah: Growing up, I think I suppressed my Native identity because II was surrounded by a sea of whiteness. I thought I was the only Native Deaf girl in the world if you can you imagine what that was like. Carolyn Gomez: I went from a Spanish-influenced environment into the Deaf school which was almost all white.

At first, I thought that we were all the same because of the common experience of being Deaf. But I grew to recognize that I was also coming into contact with white culture. Jeff Liun: As I grew up and left Georgia, I realized I didn’t really have a sense of identity. I didn’t have any exposure to my culture.

I knew from my parents that we were Taiwanese, but I didn’t have any sense of what that really meant. Mason Tubby: In my school, the only mention of Indians was when we talked about Thanksgiving and the pilgrims. There was really nothing of any depth about Native culture. Paddy Ladd: By studying other minority experiences we can understand what’s really happening for us. Think of it this way.

If you are a member of the white and hearing community, you generally have a single cultural identity. With that single identity, you move through the world with relative ease. Now, suppose you are white and Deaf. Now you have two cultural identities. This may not have that much of an impact on your life if you have two identities that are viewed as equal in value.

However, if one of those identities is seen as “lesser”, you are faced with competing and conflicting experiences of being both a minority and a majority with uncertainty about which identity to embrace. While there can be privileges from embracing the norms of the majority, in this case, hearing, culture, there are also pitfalls.

The oppressive tendencies and discriminatory behaviors of white, hearing people are part of those norms and we have to somehow rid ourselves of that. If you are also a person of color, then the challenge becomes even greater. Now you are working with multiple cultural identities with no clear path as to which should be primary at any given time.

For people who identify as white and Deaf, our response to this intersectionality is to respectfully listen. To take time to understand the journey of people of color. To offer mutual affirmation and support. We can learn so much from the research and wealth of knowledge in communities of color. All this is true of any kind of cultural identity.

Whether you are a woman, gay, lesbian or trans, a person with a disability, deaf or deafblind, it’s a tough road discovering the maintaining all these identities at once. We must learn to be patient, kind to one another, accepting and coming together as one unified whole that can stand up to dominant society.

We must work together. Laurene: We shared about the statistics of how a significant portion of Deaf learners are students of color. Now, we share more of their frustrations, struggles, and frequently, their questions of why things are the way they are. Victoria: In high school I was so frustrated by my classmates.

My own work was constantly being interrupted by classmates asking me to explain things the teacher said because they could not understand the teacher. I would start on an assignment only to have the kid in front of me turn around and ask me for help. It fell on me to become the de facto teacher. By the time I’d helped everyone else just understand what to do, there was no time left for me to do my own work.

I guess it just became me educating myself as I went along. White Teacher: ... read... ... book ... ...history... What? Black Male Student: I don’t understand. Teacher: A­-a-­gain. Black Male Student: I don’t get it. White Teacher: Can, uh, you, um... ...please, uh, help..them... Black Female Student: Ok, what don’t you understand? Victoria: It made me wish even harder that we would have teachers who were fluent in ASL.

We want the most qualified person teaching us! Nha: As kids, I think we all go through a phase where we pick on and tease each other. With me though, it seemed to never let up. The constant bullying was intolerable. For instance, North Korea detonated their first atomic bomb when I was in elementary school.

The next thing you know, everyone was on me asking if I was from there and telling me how “my people” were horrible and dangerous. It was really hurtful. Even when I tried explaining the difference between North and South Korea and how I had never even seen it, they kept at it. I grew up in America just like them but I could never convince them.

All through school, I just remember how mean people were to me. Carolyn: I grew up eating with my hands. We would just grab a tortilla and use it to pick up the food. We never used forks, it was just unnecessary. When I sat down for my first meal at the school for the deaf, all I saw was a fork. There was nothing I could use to scoop up the food in a traditional way.

I decided to take the slice of bread sitting on my tray, remove the butter from the top, and then do my best to press that bread into a pseudo­tortilla. The second I scooped up the food the staff leapt all over me, telling me I was eating wrong! Staff: You can’t eat with your hands. Use your folk. White girl: Here. You can use my bread.

Latina: Thanks. Marsha Ireland: I went to school with long braids, but they forced me to cut my hair there ­ without my parents’ knowledge or permission. David Hamilton: I definitely experienced continued harassment from the staff. Sometimes, I would get in trouble for something when other students didn’t get in trouble for the same things.

At first I didn’t realize what what happening. One time I wanted to go over to my friend’s house for the weekend. Other students were going but I was told that I couldn’t go. When I asked why, I found out the parents didn’t want me to come over because I was black. That was a real wake­up call for me. I started to see the patterns of discrimination and prejudice all around me, like in the harassment from teachers and the house parents.

Aurora: I grew up going to school in a mainstreamed setting in Texas. My parents were of the belief that I would get a better education from hearing teachers. But that meant I really was delayed in learning anything about Deaf culture. School was very isolating for me. Without direct communication, I often felt very lonely and didn’t understand all of what was going on around me.

Chad Wolfe: Other students often made insulting comments to me about Native people. They believed all the stereotypes and said all native people were poor, or drunks or on drugs. They said that’s who I was as well. I remember a time when I approached two white girls and asked them to play and they said my hair was smelly because I was Native and sent me away.

All the while, I just internalized my anger and hurt until my rage finally boiled over and I struck out at some other students who were white. I even hit one of the teachers and was expelled from the Deaf school. Nellie McKay Cody: There is a lot of mental colonization, and abuse that takes place in schools for Native youth.

The textbooks don’t represent Native culture or the true history of indigenous people. Most often, the authors of the books are white. Sarah: I remember learning about Christopher Columbus in school. We had plays about the early days of European settlement in North America. And I thought I knew so much about American history.

Heck, I was even in our school play about the first Thanksgiving! Then, after I graduated, my mom had me read a book that explained about what really happened to Native people. How Columbus’ legacy was really one of genocide. It was very disappointing to learn how mis­educated I had been. Victorica: Growing up, I dreamed of going to Gallaudet.

I remember telling one of the staff working in the Dorm..... Little girl: “I want to go to Gallaudet someday, what do you think?” Staff person: “You don’t don’t want to do that! Gallaudet has too many gay and lesbian students as well as drugs, partying and other risks so you shouldn’t even think of going.

” Victoria: Her commentary was so hostile about Gallaudet and she encouraged me to pick a local school, that would be a better fit for me. Her comments sure made me question my dream. Laurene: You have just seen some powerful stories from these individuals testimonies of the struggles involved in learning who they are within a system that does not support them.

a system that does not support them. Now we want to also share some of the success stories of how individuals have been able to work their way to the top of that mountain. Nha Kim: I would love to see more prominent Deaf Asian women as role models. At the same time, I want to learn more about my own identity and Asian culture in general.

More often, Asian men might be role models, but there are specific issues that I don’t feel comfortable addressing with them. David: I think it is important that we as teachers need to recruit and encourage black students to be successful. I am glad to set an example, but I think it is important that it is more than just me who is a role model.

Hopefully, we can get more black students to come and be successful. Jeff: I knew that California had more diversity. Going there helped me learn about other cultures as well as my own. Then, I had a chance to go to Taiwan and meet my family and deaf people there. Those experiences were both inspiring and have helped me come to this place where I am very happy with who I am.

Alice Rash: I really started off without any cultural knowledge. I knew superficial things from Black culture like food and dance ­ being with my family I learned that. But it was just scratching the surface. When I went to Gallaudet, I really didn’t understand anything about my identity. That’s when I really started learning about the complexity of my identity as a black woman who was also deaf.

Learning about these three parts of my identity that was like having scales fall from my eyes. I’m so thankful for what Gallaudet gave me. Without that, I don’t think I would be a teacher. [gallaudet logo] What Gallaudet taught me about my own identity was key for me being an effective teacher for deaf students.

[photo of Gallaudet] It is really critical that we need to recruit more diverse teachers. That is essential. Victoria: When I was 5, my brother asked me if I wanted to go to the public library. I wasn’t sure, but he talked me into going with him. The library itself was tiny. [image of the tiny library] Of all the people there, I was the only deaf person, but I worked through that and it was there that I developed my love of books.

In some ways, I think that library saved my life. The library was the launching pad for my literacy. Ericka Thompson: Here at my school, I coordinate school accreditation which includes collecting data on student achievement scores. The study body we have is very diverse. White students are only 17% of the school population.

Hispanic students make up about 59% and Black students are about 13% ­ so we have a majority of Hispanic students. It is good to know that we are able to assist students in improving their academic achievement. We have to document their progress on the state’s Academic Progress Index and keep up with the elevated standards for student achievement Our white students have gained on average 5 points, showing that they are progressing well but they generally came in with a good command of language.

For our Hispanic students, on the other hand, the average gain was 69 points over one year! What’s more, the black students gained 109 points. This jump in progress happens because they often come to us later in their high school career or at the end of middle school and while we aren’t certain what took place previously in their schooling, they are able to pick things up quickly in this environment. It is exciting to see those gains.

Aurora: I am happy that I was able to transfer to the California School for the Deaf at Riverside. I came in late in 8th grade. I love it here and have absolutely no regrets. Erica Hossler: We need more in­depth social justice training. Jill Baldwin: I think all teachers need to know that ALL students, not one, not most, If teachers truly believe that, then the kids feel it and have the sense that their teacher really believes in them.

Superintendent Sandra Edwards: My challenge as a superintendent is to figure out how to provide appropriate educational services for my students. Whatever role I have been in, whether teacher, principal, or superintendent, my goal has always been to provide the best educational fit for each student regardless of their background.

 This has to happen whether they have hearing or deaf parents, strong Deaf identity or are still developing their identity. Here at the Mississippi School for the Deaf, we have a large population of students of color, including both Latino and Black students. They frequently struggle because we have a hard time recruiting teachers of color to provide a good support system during the educational process.

It is important that all my teachers, whether they are teachers of color or white, have high expectations for ALL my students. That is a key criteria when I hire teachers. At the same time, recruitment of teachers of color is difficult because not many people of color are entering the field of education.

We exert a lot of effort trying to convince teachers of color to come to our state because of the high percentage of students of color here. So, that is really my biggest challenges: how to recruit more teachers of color and ensure that all of my teachers have high expectations for all my students. Another issue for us and other Deaf schools around the nation is that often students come to us late in their academic career.

They may be delayed with language and academics as well as development of any Deaf identity. They may not be fluent in sign language or have developed much English literacy. This can be just as true for white students as it is for students of color. In addressing this challenge, I think the university system bears some responsibility.

They need to develop pedagogical approaches that can address these gaps for students. They also need to recruit more college students of color to be the future teachers who will be in the pool that superintendents like me can draw from when recruiting new faculty. Diversity has to include students who are Deaf as well.

 There are already a lot of hearing, white females enrolled in programs, and I think universities need to do a better job of recruiting a more diverse cohorts of students who make it through graduation tobecome licensed so that I will have a more diverse pool to recruit from to better meet the needs of our students here at MSD.

Victorica: There was one teacher, Howard Palmer, who is a Deaf white man, who called me over one day at school and made me promise him two things: that I would get a high school diploma and finish a college degree. I readily agreed to that and then he said that he knew I could even go on and get my doctorate.

That gave me an immediate bump of confidence. He gave me a big hug, a kiss on the forehead and did a pinky­swear, fist bump handshake that ended with a big thumbs up before he walked away. His high expectations for me really solidified my confidence and commitment to carrying out those promises. That day stands out so clearly in my memory.

Two days after that encounter, Howard Palmer passed away which was very hard on me emotionally. But I have never forgotten what he asked me to commit to. I graduated from my school, got my AA degree, and will soon get my B.S. from Gallaudet. I consider all of that, in part, carrying on Howard Palmer’s legacy.

And now here I am, a graduate of Gallaudet. I think back to the dorm staff who told me not to attend this school because of all the horrible things they said were here But I am here and I made it! Laurene: Now you have had the chance to learn from the stories of a variety of individuals. You’ve seen their struggles and challenges as they progressed on their journeys with education and with the development of their identities.

 A lot of challenges, but there was also joy as they celebrated the times they overcame the barriers in their way. They show us how they navigated through the avalanche and climbed to the summit of success. Thanks for watching. I’m Laurene Simms.
